# Stack Project

> About 2,000 companies have implemented a subscription-style delivery service into their business plans. - Forbes


## What is a Stack app?
- Stack app is an iOS application which tracks your online subscriptions systematically.
- There are more and more subscription business models around the world. Itâ€™s time to manage them in a smart way. ðŸ˜Ž
- **At this point, Stack is a personal toy project.** I'd like to launch app in the future, but I don't know when it will be.

## Why you start this project?
- As I've been spending over $190 every month on subscribing online services like Creative Cloud, Netflix, Youtube Red, iCloud, or Dropbox, I need an assistant tool which can organize my subscriptions systematically. At First, I designed a simple chatbot(based on Facebook Messenger) focusing on d-day notification skills before subscriptions are automatically renewed. [Mockups are here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/54607233/Organize-your-subscriptions-with-Cash-bot) But as an iOS developer, and also as an iPhoneX user, I decide to make a native app first. This repo contains the whole process of development.


## Development goal
- Written in pure-Swift
- Targeting iOS 11 as the base SDK
- Engage new iOS features 
- Experiment with lots of CocoaPods


## Spec
- **Explore** famous subscription services around the world.
- **Add** new subscription to your own stack list. 
- You can also **Edit or Remove** your saved subscriptions.
- Get **notified** before your subscriptions are automatically renewed!
- You can also manage your all subscription plans in a **Calendar mode**.
